/// Taken from SVCOMP'15, compiled to T2 via llvm2kittel.
/// Original example comes with the following information:
///
/// Date: 2012-02-12
/// Author: leike@informatik.uni-freiburg.de
///
/// Ranking function: f(x, a, b) = x;
/// needs the loop invariant b >= a.
///
/// This example exposed a bug in program path slicing,
/// manifesting itself in proving it to be nonterminating.
/// The issue was reported by Le Ton Chanh <chanhle@comp.nus.edu.sg>.
