V2.0 (Sun Aug 12 23:03:15 BST 2012, Ruslan Ledesma-Garza)
  * Adapted the benchmarks for translation into the format of T2. The
    following changes were applied:
    - Removed inclusion of stdlib.h and defined NULL as 0 where
      needed.
    - Renamed the main function as 'main'.
    - Marked all other functions with 'inline'.
  * The benchmarks
    - nsichneu.c
    - recursion.c
    - fac.c
    - duff.c
    - adpcm.c
    were not translated into the format of T2. The translation utility
    could not deal with the program.
