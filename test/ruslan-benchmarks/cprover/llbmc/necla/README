Versioning information
----------------------

V1.0 (2008, Sriram Sankaranarayanan): 
  * Initial Release

V1.1 (Jan. 2011, Franjo Ivancic):
  * Updated bugs file for examples ex13, ex25, ex28, and ex40. 
  * Slight changes made to examples ex40 and ex41. 
  * We are grateful to Lucas Cordeiro from the University of Southampton
    for pointing out a number of inconsistencies in the expected results file. 

V1.2 (Sun Aug 12 22:54:10 BST 2012, Ruslan Ledesma-Garza)
  * Adapted the benchmarks for translation into the format of T2. The
    following changes were applied:
    - Removed inclusion of stdlib.h and defined NULL as 0 where
      needed.
    - Renamed the main function as 'main'.
    - Marked all other functions with 'inline'.
  * Benchmarks ex37.c and ex43.c were not translated into the format
    of T2. The translation utility could not deal with the programs.
